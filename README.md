# Round-two-liverwort-growth-rate-analysis
Round two of time series analysis of plant growth for PhD.

The experimental setup and data analysis is very similar to [Liverwort-growth-rate-analysis] (https://github.com/linbug/Liverwort-growth-rate-analysis) but was a performed with a different set of lines (pHART lines, with MpEF promoter).

See the ipython notebook [here.] (http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/linbug/Round-two-liverwort-growth-rate-analysis/blob/master/growth%20rate%20analysis%20pHART.ipynb)
